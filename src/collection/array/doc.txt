Random Access
	LinkedList supports get(int index) operation but internally it traverses the list from start or end which ever is closer depending on the length. 
	So it’s not efficient and not random.
	Random access means that whether you get the element at index 1 or at index 10000 of 50000 elements, 
	it should take same time but for LinkedList it will take more time because it will have to skip first 9999 elements to get the desired element.
	ArrayList supports random access, means whether you are accessing index 1 or 10000 of 50000 elements, time to get the element will be same.
	If you look at the implementation of ArrayList and LinkedList, you will see that ArrayList implements RandomAccess interface whereas LinkedList does not.
