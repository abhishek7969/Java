>>The class is final so we cannot create the subclass and override its methods..
>>Once an object is created and initialized, it cannot be modified.
>>How about methods such as trim that remove leading and trailing whitespace characters — 
do such methods modify the state of the String object? No. If there are any leading or trailing whitespace characters, 
thse trim method removes them and returns a new String object instead of modifying that String object.

>>Rules to make a immutable class 
Make class as a Final
Make all the immutable instance variable as a Final
Extra care needs for the mutable instance variables such as Data and Collection list as they can be accessed outside and changed.
	Make sure that the methods don’t change the contents inside those mutable objects.
	Don’t share the references outside the classes 
	If you must return a reference, return the deep copy of the object
